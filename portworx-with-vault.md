# Portworx with Vault

This guide will get a Portworx cluster up which is connected to a Vault endpoint. The vault endpoint could be used to store secrets which will be used for encrypting volumes.

## Setting up Vault

Peruse [this section](https://www.vaultproject.io/intro/getting-started/install.html) for help on setting up Vault in your setup. This includes installation, configuring secrets, etc

## Deploying Portworx

You can start PX on a node via the Docker CLI as follows

```text
if `uname -r | grep -i coreos > /dev/null`; \
then HDRS="/lib/modules"; \
else HDRS="/usr/src"; fi
sudo docker run --restart=always --name px -d --net=host       \
                 --privileged=true                             \
                 -v /run/docker/plugins:/run/docker/plugins    \
                 -v /var/lib/osd:/var/lib/osd:shared           \
                 -v /dev:/dev                                  \
                 -v /etc/pwx:/etc/pwx                          \
                 -v /opt/pwx/bin:/export_bin:shared            \
                 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  \
                 -v /var/cores:/var/cores                      \
                 -v ${HDRS}:${HDRS}                            \
                 -e "VAULT_ADDR=<vault-address>" \
                 -e "VAULT_TOKEN=<vault-token>" \
                portworx/px-enterprise:latest -daemon -k etcd://myetc.company.com:2379 -c MY_CLUSTER_ID -s \
        /dev/sdb -s /dev/sdc -secret_type vault -cluster_secret_key <secret-id>
```

All the arguments to the docker run command are explained [here](https://github.com/venkatpx/px-docs/tree/3f39ba94d6d6d91385dcd6792eb6da61d0016b4d/install/docker.html). The two new arguments related to Vault are:

```text
- secret_type
    > Instructs PX to use Vault as the secret endpoint to fetch secrets from

- cluster_secret_key
    > Sets the cluster-wide secretID. This secret will be used to
    fetch the secret stored in Vault. The secret will be used as a
    passphrase for encrypting all the volumes.
```

You need to add two extra Docker runtime commands

```text
-e "VAULT_ADDRESS=<vault-address>"
    > Sets the VAULT_ADDRESS environment variable. It would be used
    to connect to the Vault endpoint.

-e "VAULT_TOKEN=<vault-token>"
    > Sets the VAULT_TOKEN environment variable. This token will be
    used for authenticating PX with Vault.
```

All the above Vault related fields as well as the cluster secret key can be set using PX CLI which is explained in the next section.

## Authenticating with Vault using PX CLI

If you do not wish to set Vault environment variables, you can authenticate PX with Vault using PX CLI. Run the following commands:

```text
# /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets vault login
Enter VAULT_ADDRESS: <vault-endpoint-address>
Enter VAULT_TOKEN: ********
Successfully authenticated with Vault.
```

**Important: You need to run this command on all PX nodes, so that you could create and mount encrypted volumes on all nodes**

## Setting cluster wide secret key

A cluster wide secret key is a common key that can be used to encrypt all your volumes. You can set the cluster secret key using the following command

```text
# /opt/pwx/bin/pxctl secrets set-cluster-key
Enter cluster wide secret key: *****
Successfully set cluster secret key!
```

**Important: Make sure that the secret key has been created in Vault**

If the CLI is used to authenticate with Vault, for every restart of PX container it needs to be re-authenticated with Vault by running the `login` command.
