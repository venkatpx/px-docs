## 1.0.8 Release Notes

* Incremental fixes to the pxctl upgrade that showed version mismatch between the CLI and px daemon after upgrades
* Add support for cloud providers like Packet

## 1.0.7 Release Notes

### Key Features

* Continual online drive health monitoring.

### Key Issues addressed

* Fix for Lighthouse reporting some nodes as online when the entire cluster is down.
* Shared volumes can occasionally cause high CPU spikes.  This has been fixed.
* Improvements to the shared volumes throughput.
* Lighthouse had a bug causing occasional incorrect volume to container mapping.  This has been fixed. 
* Password reset in Lighthouse has been fixed.

## 1.0.6 Release Notes

### Key Features

* Support for Consul
* Ability to add storage to a head-only node
* Ability to import data from an external storage source
* Ability to bootstrap and deploy PX through external automated procedures.  PX takes command line parameters and does not need a config.json.

### Key Issues addressed

* Fix for occasional PX node restart.  Occasionaly during heavy load, a PX node would get marked down by gossip, and asked to restart.  While this did not cause any noticable delay in IO, it would flood the logs with gossip error messages.  This bug has been fixed.
* Minor CLI enhancements around displaying IP addresses instead of node IDs \(where possible\).
