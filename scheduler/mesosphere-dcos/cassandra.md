This guide will help you to install the [Cassandra](https://portworx.com/use-case/cassandra-docker-container/) service on your DCOS cluster backed by PX volumes for persistent storage.

Since the stateful services in DCOS universe do not have support for external volumes, you will need to add additional repositories to your DCOS cluster to install the services mentioned here.

The source code for these services can be found here: [Portworx DCOS-Commons Frameworks](https://github.com/portworx/dcos-commons)

> **Note:**  
> This framework is only supported directly by Portworx. Please contact support@portworx.com directly for any support issues related with using this framework.

Please make sure you have installed [Portworx on DCOS](https://github.com/venkatpx/px-docs/tree/3f39ba94d6d6d91385dcd6792eb6da61d0016b4d/scheduler/mesosphere-dcos/install.html) before proceeding further.

## Adding the repository for the service:

For this step you will need to login to a node which has the dcos cli installed and is authenticated to your DCOS cluster.

Run the following command to add the repository to your DCOS cluster:

```text
$ dcos package repo add --index=0 cassandra-px-aws https://px-dcos.s3.amazonaws.com/v1/cassandra-px/cassandra-px.zip
```

Once you have run the above command you should see the Cassandra-PX service available in your universe

## Installation

### Default Install

If you want to use the defaults, you can now run the dcos command to install the service

```text
$ dcos package install --yes cassandra-px
```

You can also click on the “Install” button on the WebUI next to the service and then click “Install Package”.

### Advanced Install

If you want to modify the default, click on the “Install” button next to the package on the DCOS UI and then click on “Advanced Installation”

Here you have the option to change the service name, volume name, volume size,and provide any additional options that you want to pass to the docker volume driver. You can also configure other Cassandra related parameters on this page including the number of Cassandra nodes.

Click on “Review and Install” and then “Install” to start the installation of the service.

## Install Status

Once you have started the install you can go to the Services page to monitor the status of the installation.

If you click on the Cassandra-PX service you should be able to look at the status of the nodes being created. There will be one service for the scheduler and one service each for the Cassandra nodes.

When the Scheduler service as well as the Cassandra nodes are in Running \(green\) status, you should be ready to start using the Cassandra cluster.

If you check your Portworx cluster, you should see multiple volumes that were automatically created using the options provided during install, one for each node of the Cassandra cluster.

If you run the “dcos service” command you should see the cassandra-px service in ACTIVE state with 3 running tasks, one for each cassandra node.

```text
 $ dcos service           
NAME                            HOST                    ACTIVE  TASKS  CPU    MEM    DISK  ID

```

## Scaling the number of nodes

You do not need to create additional volumes of perform to scale up your cluster. Just go to the Cassandra service page, click on the three dots on the top right corner of the page, select “nodes”, scroll down and increase the nodes parameter to the desired nodes.

Click on “Review and Run” and then “Run Service”. The service scheduler should restart with the updated node count and create more Cassandra nodes. Please make sure you have enough resources and nodes available to scale up the number of nodes. You also need to make sure Portworx is installed on all the agents in the DCOS cluster.
